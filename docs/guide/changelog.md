# How to add Changelog

## What changes need a Changelog?

Modified files under `packages`

- @ant-design/web3-assets
- @ant-design/web3-common
- @ant-design/web3-icons
- @ant-design/web3-solana
- @ant-design/web3-wagmi
- @ant-design/web3

## How to generate changelog

1. First of all, you need to run the command:

<NormalCommand command="changeset"></NormalCommand>

```
MacBook-Pro ant-design-web3 % pnpm changeset

> @ant-design/web3-docs@0.0.0 changeset ant-design-web3
> changeset
```

2. Select the modified package by space and press enter to confirmã€‚

```
ðŸ¦‹  Which packages would you like to include? â€¦
â—‰ changed packages
  â—‰ @ant-design/web3
â—¯ unchanged packages
  â—¯ @ant-design/web3-assets
  â—¯ @ant-design/web3-common
  â—¯ @ant-design/web3-icons
  â—¯ @ant-design/web3-solana
  â—¯ @ant-design/web3-wagmi
```

```
ðŸ¦‹  Which packages would you like to include? Â· @ant-design/web3
ðŸ¦‹  Which packages should have a major bump? â€¦
â—¯ all packages
  â—¯ @ant-design/web3@1.9.0
```

3. At this point, we should skip it with a carriage return. For bugfixes in general, we select the last `patch` version, and we select `minor` for newer features.ã€‚

```
ðŸ¦‹  Which packages should have a major bump? Â· No items were selected
ðŸ¦‹  Which packages should have a minor bump? Â· No items were selected
ðŸ¦‹  The following packages will be patch bumped:
ðŸ¦‹  @ant-design/web3@1.9.0
ðŸ¦‹  Please enter a summary for this change (this will be in the changelogs).
ðŸ¦‹    (submit empty line to open external editor)
ðŸ¦‹  Summary â€º
```

4. As a final step, we submit message in the `Summary` that conforms to [Angular's commit convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).

```
ðŸ¦‹  Summary â€º feat: support more icons
```
