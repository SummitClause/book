# More Courses

After completing the Ant Design Web3 Introductory course, students interested in DApp development can continue to learn more in-depth.

You can find more courses at [WTF Academy](https://www.wtf.academy/), e.g. if you want to learn how to develop Solidity contracts, you can take the [Introduction to Solidity Course](https://www.wtf.academy/solidity-start).

We're also working on an advanced [DApp course](https://github.com/WTFAcademy/WTF-Dapp) with [WTF Academy](https://www.wtf.academy/), so keep an eye out for that as well.
