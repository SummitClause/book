# Introduction

This course is mainly for students who have a certain foundation of front-end development, helping you move from Web2 to Web3 and gain the ability to develop DApp (decentralized application).

The course is divided into three parts:

- **What is DApp?** This part mainly introduces the basic concepts to help you understand the basic concepts of blockchain and smart contracts, and let you know what a DApp front-end development needs, and lay a foundation for the follow-up practice.
- **Develop DApp** This part will take you from 0 to 1 to build a DApp front-end, including initializing the project, connecting the blockchain account, and calling the contract. In this part, you donâ€™t need to care about the smart contract. We will provide a contract that has been deployed. You only need to focus on the development of the front end.
- **Develop smart contract** Students who are interested in blockchain can continue to learn this part and replace the contract developed in the second part with their own smart contracts.

The course will be based on [Ant Design Web3](https://web3.ant.design/) for explanation, so that you can get started more easily. Of course, this will not affect your understanding of the basic concepts. We will explain the relevant concepts in the course to ensure that you can master the basic knowledge of DApp development after the course is completed.

The course will guide you to finally create a minimum viable DApp, which implements the display and minting functions of an NFT. The following is an example of the final result:

This course has certain prerequisites, which require you to have a basic understanding of [React](https://react.dev/) front-end development. If you are not familiar with React, you can learn the [React official documentation](https://react.dev/learn) first.
